          <h2>Timeline</h2>
          <p class="timeline-para">Following March 2020, with schools moving online, I got a lot of time to expand my
            knowledge and explore the opportunities that the Computer Science field holds. I have spent the last few years
            exploring and learning about all sorts of technologies in a variety of fields. Here's a timeline showing the
            progress throughout.</p>

                <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
                <p>One of the first things I took up during the pandemic was Graphic Design. Creating digital art was
                  something I have always wanted to do, and so I started learning Adobe Illustrator. I loved the entire
                  learning process, and I really encourage people to take this up if they have any interest in art at
                  all. It was a slow start but over the last few years I have improved a lot and added more onto my
                  skill set by learning Adobe Photoshop as well to help me in making poster designs and other
                  illustrative designs.</p>
                <p>I started freelancing for a while but switched my focus to software development and projects soon
                  after. I still make posters and illustrations as a hobby from time to time.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="section-content strategy">
                <h2>Certifications and Learning</h2>
                <p> Around June 2020, I had finally made the decision of pursuing Computer Science in University after
                  which I tried to make the most of my "free time" by taking up online courses to explore different fields
                  such as Data Science, Cyber Security, IT Support, Cloud Computing, Java and more. These courses were
                  mainly taken to give me an idea of what the field holds and what I want to specialize in, during my time
                  in university and beyond. I have completed over 60 courses from sites like Coursera, FreeCodeCamp,
                  Udemy, etc. Credible or not, I'm happy to have gained a ton of knowledge from these.</p>
                <p>After all that theoretical knowledge gained from the
                  Courses and YouTube videos, I realized the best way forward now is to put the knowledge into practice
                  and start building my projects.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="section-content creative">
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>I started working on projects by late 2021. I had made a decision to take a gap year before starting
                  university to build up my portfolio and look for early opportunities in the field. Surprisingly, I did
                  not end up wasting my year and worked on intermediate projects even before joining university.</p>
                <p>At first, I had no set plan or ideas to build upon. After a bit of research I found Jetbrains Academy
                  that provided project-oriented learning, split up into various stages of the project. This was really
                  helpful to me, and I strongly recommend this website to anyone starting out their coding journey.</p>
                <p>I pushed myself more and started working on more projects of my own, like this website, and learnt a
                  lot about Version Control and GitHub along the way. The pandemic was a terrible thing, but I did find
                  a silver lining as it allowed me to improve a lot as a developer and student.</p>
                <p></p>
              </div>

              <div class="section-content production">
                <h2>My First Hackathon</h2>
                <p>October 2022. I attended my first hackathon, Hack The Valley 7 which was hosted at the
                  University of Toronto Scarborough. They hosted a ton of workshops covering various topics like
                  technical interviews, Site Reliability Engineering, React, etc. It was a great learning experience for
                  me, and I also got to network with a lot of people.</p>

                <p>Putting my development skills at work, we managed to build a website and a design prototype for our
                  app <a href="https://devpost.com/software/sustainu-app" class="repo" target="_blank">SustainU</a>.
                  We were learning, building, designing and documenting on the fly as it was the first
                  hackathon for all of my teammates as well.</p>

                <p>With over 600+ participants, and people coming from all around Ontario, I did not expect much from
                  myself. Spanning across 3 days of complete sleep deprivation and unhealthy
                  amounts of caffeine, also happened to be my first ever win. SustainU was named the Best Nature Hack.
                  It is hands down my greatest achievement till date, and it's something I'm really proud of. All that
                  effort I had put in over the past couple years, had finally paid off.
                </p>

              <div class="section-content analysis active">
                <h2>Currently Working On</h2>
                <p>My main focus right now is improving this website and trying to make it more responsive. I am just
                  getting started with frameworks and responsive design, and I hope to incorporate my learnings into this
                  website as soon as possible. Any resources and advice is always welcome, please feel free to reach out
                  to me using the Contact section :)</p>

                <p>Moreover, I am always trying to find ways to fine-tune my existing projects in terms of efficiency
                  and aesthetics. I have got a lot to improve on the overall design of the Text Editor and actively
                  working on adding more features to it. Again, any and all input is always appreciated and welcome.</p>

                <p>Lastly, I am working towards attending and winning a lot more hackathons in the coming months, and I
                  hope to gain a lot from them as they come. </p>
