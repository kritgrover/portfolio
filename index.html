          <p class="timeline-para">Following March 2020, with schools moving online, I got a lot of time to expand my
            knowledge and explore the opportunities that the field of Computer Science holds. I have spent the last few years
            exploring and learning about all sorts of technologies in a variety of fields. Here's a timeline showing the
